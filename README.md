# Animated HTML & CSS Penguin.

A flappy Penguin made solely out of HTML & CSS. 

The penguin will keep waving at you whilst giving you a smile! 

If you click and hold the penguin, the penguin will grow in size just go give you a bit more positivity.

Really fun build to make and the penguin is just so cute.
